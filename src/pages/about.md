# About Me

I am a full-stack software engineer who enjoys solving complex problems by creating innovative and delightful user interfaces. My goal is to build solutions that are both powerful and intuitive for the end-user.

### My Approach & Philosophy

I thrive in collaborative, agile teams that prioritise user needs. I believe that the best software is not only effective but also easy to maintain, which is why I am dedicated to writing clean, thoroughly tested, and well-documented code.

### Core Technologies

* React
* .NET
* TypeScript
* Node.js

### A Project I'm Proud Of

I was a key contributor in transforming a legacy paper-based process into a modern, seamless web experience. For this project, I engineered a multi-step form for ordering access cards that greatly improved the user journey. Key features included the ability to save progress and a dynamic 3D render of the card that updated in real-time as the user made selections.

### Outside of Work

Away from the keyboard, you can find me baking or cooking, engaging in a friendly board game, or exploring the outdoors on an adventure with my dog, Otis.
